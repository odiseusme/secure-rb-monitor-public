# Rosen Bridge Monitor - Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and adjust values as needed

# Host interface binding (127.0.0.1 = localhost only, 0.0.0.0 = allow LAN access)
HOST_IP=127.0.0.1

# Host port for accessing the monitor (will be auto-selected if not set)
# This is the port you'll use in your browser: http://localhost:HOST_PORT
HOST_PORT=8080

# Internal container port (fixed at 8080, do not change)
MONITOR_PORT=8080

# How often the monitor updates data (milliseconds)
UPDATE_INTERVAL=30000

# Timezone for log timestamps (use your local timezone like America/New_York)
TZ=UTC

# Note: HOST_PORT is the external port you access from your browser
# MONITOR_PORT is the internal container port (always 8080)
# The docker-compose maps HOST_IP:HOST_PORT -> container:MONITOR_PORT
