# README Enhancement Plan

## Issues Found:
1. ❌ References version "v1.0" (outdated - should be v1.2.1)
2. ❌ References "register-user.sh v2.1.0" in QR section (should be v1.2.1)
3. ⚠️ Quick Start could be more prominent (currently buried after overview)
4. ⚠️ No mention of new v1.2.0+ features (compact QR, two-step prompts)
5. ✅ Structure is good

4. ✏️ Mention dry run feature in Quick Start
5. ✏️ Update "Status: v1.0" to "Status: v1.2.1"

## Priority: MEDIUM
- No blocking issues
- Just version updates and minor enhancements
- Can be done quickly (< 10 min)
